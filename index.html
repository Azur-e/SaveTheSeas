  <p> 
    The World's Oceans have some of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world, 
    even being in a higher place than rainforests. 
    Unfortunately the oceans suffer from many issues, 
    like coral bleaching, pollution, overfishing, 
    and the destruction of habitat.

  Marine ecosystems represent a vital component of the global ecosystem, yet they are currently facing significant challenges that threaten their survival, such as climate change, pollution and overfishing. The collapse of the oceanic ecosystem could potentially lead to the gradual degradation of all life on Earth. This phenomenon is observable in every ocean worldwide, although the focus here is on the Australian oceans, which are home to numerous significant ecosystems, including the Great Barrier Reef and the Antarctic migration current.

  “We still have 10 percent of the sharks. We still have half of the coral reefs. However, if we wait another 50 years, opportunities might well be gone” -Sylvia Earle

  The world's oceans have the greatest biodiversity and support millions of life forms, which means they are also the most vulnerable to climate change. An example of this is Australia's Great Barrier Reef, which has recently experienced problems such as severe coral bleaching and sea urchins. Coral bleaching occurs when corals are over-stressed, causing them to expel their symbiotic partners, the algae. Without their algae, the corals' skeletons are exposed, which does not mean they are dead, it just means they are far more susceptible to environmental events and disease, and in long periods of time; starvation. Coral bleaching occurs in many ways, one of which is when water temperatures rise, even small amounts of one degree Celsius for just three weeks can cause bleaching.
